This is the Java Spring solution for the backend to the guildrose test

You will need gradle

build with

gradle clean build -x test

All dependencies sproing etc should be downloaded

There is an integration test, can build and run with

gradle clean build

To launch server

gradle bootRun

We have used a local database and datasource in the answer

For the tests to run, mysql should be initialied using the script

/src/main/resources/schema.sql

With the user and password set up the the test should run

alternative edit the user password and database new new GildedDatasource


============

React

front end not quite working (no errors but empty screen) but code is there

in directory

react/gilded

first run

npm install

then

npm start

And it will load the front end on port 3000 in a browser

======

localhost was not work working in react, so edit file "[base]/react/gilded/src/http-common.js" and App.js

and replace "http://http://192.168.56.111 with "http://your.ip.address.on.the.lan"
